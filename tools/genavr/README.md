This directory contains a framework for creating custom compilers for
cryptographic primitives on AVR.  The code generated by this framework
will usually be better than that created by a C compiler because it can
directly optimize at the instruction and register level.

While it is possible to write primitives by hand in assembly, it can be
daunting to keep all the registers and memory locations straight in a
human brain.  This framework removes the human error and makes it easier
to generate highly-optimized assembly code for AVR.

The framework also includes an AVR interpreter that can be used to run
test vectors on a desktop machine to check the correctness of the
generated code independently of an actual AVR device.  Run "make check"
in this directory to run all test vectors.
