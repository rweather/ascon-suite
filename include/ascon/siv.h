/**
 * \file siv.h
 * \brief SIV encryption primitives built around the ASCON permutation.
 *
 * This API provides support for SIV mode (Synthetic Initialization
 * Vector).  SIV mode authenticates the associated data and the plaintext
 * before encrypting the plaintext.
 *
 * The SIV construction makes the result resistant against reuse of the
 * nonce as long as the combination of the associated data and plaintext
 * is unique.  If the combination is not unique, then the algorithm leaks
 * that the same plaintext has been encrypted again but does not reveal
 * the plaintext itself.
 *
 * SIV mode can be useful when encrypting data in memory, such as
 * encrypting a key pair for storage in non-volatile memory.  The nonce or
 * the associated data is set to the address in memory of the encrypted data,
 * so that encrypting the same data in different locations will give
 * different results.
 *
 * SIV mode increases the size of the data by 16 bytes, which provides
 * the authentication tag.  This tag must not be discarded because the
 * data cannot be successfully decrypted without it.
